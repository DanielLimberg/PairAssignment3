#Pair Assignment 3: GDP Growth and Equity Prices
## **Limberg, Daniel & Mueller, Lukas**

In this repository we provide the pair assignment 3 for the Collaborative Social Science Class at the HSoG: A first draft of our final project. 

The assignment requirements of the assignment are as follows: *"web based data from at least two sources, merge the data sets, conduct basic descriptive and inferential statistics on the data to address a relevant research question and briefly describe the results including with dynamically generated tables and figures. Students are encouraged to access data and perform statistical analyses with an eye to answering questions relevant for their Collaborative Research Project."*

The folder contains the relevant **R-scripts**, the **Rmarkdown-file** and the final **.pdf-file**. Additionally, we provide two folders with the current Code and Data we obtained for the project so far.
